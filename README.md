## *Costa, L.M. et al*

This is the repository for the code used to process the data from OCO-2
and OCO-3, in `R` folder you will find the script for downloding the
data from the `url` and some filters and process used. The **fire** data
are already processed and compressed in `.rar`. <br> <br> In the
following paths:`data-raw/OCO-2`, `data-raw/OCO-3`, `data/OCO-2` and
`data/OCO-3`, there are files to ensure the creation of that path on
github, however you can delete them.
