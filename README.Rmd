# **Combining OCO-2 and OCO-3 for Fire Foci analysis**
## *Costa, L.M. et al*

This is the repository for the code used to process the data from [OCO-2](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/OCO2_L2_Lite_FP_10r/summary) and [OCO-3](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/OCO3_L2_Lite_FP_10.4r/summary), in `R` folder you will find the script for downloding the data from the `url` and some filters and process used. The **fire** data are already processed and compressed in `.rar`. <br>
<br> In the following paths:`data-raw/OCO-2`, `data-raw/OCO-3`, `data/OCO-2` and `data/OCO-3`, there are files to ensure the creation of that path on github, however you can delete them.
